In this experiment, we explored different types of operators used in C++ to perform various operations on data. Operators are essential building blocks that allow us to process and manipulate values effectively. We practiced using arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, assignment, and miscellaneous operators with simple programs.

The goal was to understand how each operator works, where it’s used, and how operator precedence affects the result of expressions.

EXPERIMENT 3A
CHECKING WHEATHER THE NUMBER IS POSITIVE OR NOT: This program checks whether a number entered by the user is positive, negative, or zero using simple conditional (if-else) statements. It compares the input number with zero and prints the appropriate result. This helps understand how condition checking works in C++ and is a basic example of decision-making in programming.

EXPERIMENT 3B
In this program, the user inputs marks for three subjects. The program calculates the average and then determines the grade based on predefined ranges (e.g., 90+ = 'O', 80–89 = 'A+', etc.). This demonstrates how to use arithmetic and logical operators together with nested if-else statements to implement real-life decision logic in code.

EXPERIMENT 3C
This program takes the x and y coordinates as input and uses conditional checks to find whether the point lies on the X-axis, Y-axis, origin, or in one of the four quadrants. It's a great example of combining multiple conditions to handle a variety of possible outcomes using if-else and logical operators.
